The initial goal of the UmlQuick project is to automatically generate
Sequence (message trace) diagrams via a declarative QML form by
instrumenting the code being traced. Perhaps other types of diagrams
could be created in QML too. It was inspired by the UMLGraph project
http://www.umlgraph.org/doc/seq-intro.html but rewritten because I
wanted to try to use QML instead of gnu pic macros.

There are some components for viewing the generated QML, and a few
examples: how to generate the trace, and examples of complete traces.

It should work with Qt 5.7 or newer (due to some limited usage of
QtQuick.Controls 2).

Simply run qmake and make install.  Then try the examples.
