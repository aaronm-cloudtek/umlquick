The initial goal of the UmlQuick project is to automatically generate
message trace diagrams via a declarative QML form by instrumenting the
code being traced.  Perhaps other types of diagrams could be created in
QML too.  It was inspired by the UMLGraph project
http://www.umlgraph.org/doc/seq-intro.html but rewritten because I
wanted to try to use QML instead of gnu pic macros.

There are some components for viewing the generated QML, and a few
examples: how to generate the trace, and examples of complete traces.

It should work with Qt 5.7 or newer (due to some limited usage of
QtQuick.Controls 2).

uq is a script which simply runs qml with your given (possibly
generated) qml file containing the declarative UML diagram.  It can
optionally be added to your path.
